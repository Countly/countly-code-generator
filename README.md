# SDK Code Generator for analytics platforms

This application generates code to use with analytics, backend and platform SDKs. It removes the burden to go through all the documentation and integrate SDK by writing code snippets, and helps eliminate errors during implementation and integration phase.

This repository holds a fully functional Countly code generator as an example. It can be used as a starting point to write other code generators for Google Analytics, Flurry, etc.

You can reach the code generator from [here](https://countly.github.io/countly-code-generator/).
